# Getting Started with ToDo List app

First you need to run the api project

Use the command `docker-compose up` to run the project with database on docker image or, if you want, set uri database on .env file, then use the command `npm run start`<br/>
In the root folder, there is a postman collection file to prove all endpoints.

After this, run the webapp using the command npm run start
